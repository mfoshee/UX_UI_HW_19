        <span class="lt-line-clamp__line">I have been a client of Michele’s when she ran the Young Rembrandts Program in our school district. Michele is very passionate about creating Best in Class customer experience. Customer experience and understanding how to serve is what Michele knows very well, and it’s extremely important when it comes to running a successful small business and Michele exemplifies this.
<br><br>
            Specifically, I had the pleasure of working with Michele to bring a Young Rembrandts program to my children’s school and share the wealth across other schools since art after-school and summer programs were not available at that time. She was empathetic to the particular needs of our school and families, making sure to offer a program that best suited the most families possible. Her dedication and enthusiasm to offer a program the children would love and learn from had a lasting effect on my children. This was the best after school and camp program my kids took because they learned important skills to express themselves through drawings and it helped them to visualize in later academic years to put together posters and PowerPoint presentations to make complex problems clear through colors, art effects etc. which they learned at a very young age. To this day, I enjoy when they are making me beautiful drawings and excel in school. Thank you Michele for your dedication to children’s education and your relentless efforts as a small business owner!

Her enthusiasm and commitment to projects and her team are inspiring and invigorating. She managed an incredibly demanding position with grace and determination.
